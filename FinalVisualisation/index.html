          <p class = "body-text">Australia isn't usually associated with seismic activity, but it has experienced significant 
            earthquakes that have impacted its landscape and communities. Experts warn that long periods without major quakes 
            may lead to complacency <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/sep/10/what-are-earthquake-swarms-australia-risk-hunter-region" target="_blank">[1]</a>. 
            In September 2024, seismologists introduced the term "earthquake swarms" after over 30 seismic events hit the 
            Hunter region of New South Wales. While swarms are natural, some human activities, like mining, could induce them. 
            Experts are particularly concerned about building designs and locations for critical infrastructure, such as nuclear power plants.

      </div>
      <div class="pure-u-1-2">
        <div class="description description-left">
          <p class = "body-text" style = "margin-bottom: 0px;">Earthquake magnitude and depth are crucial factors 
            that significantly influence the level of damage caused by a seismic event. The magnitude of an 
            earthquake, measured on the Richter scale or the moment magnitude scale, quantifies the energy 
            released at the earthquake's source. Generally, higher magnitude earthquakes release more energy, 
            resulting in greater potential for destruction. Fortunately, Australia has never experienced an 
            earthquake of Magntiude higher than 6.4. However, the depth at which an earthquake occurs 
            also plays a vital role in determining its impact. Shallow earthquakes, typically occurring at 
            depths less than 70 kilometers, tend to cause more intense shaking and damage at the surface because 
            the seismic waves have less distance to travel. In contrast, deeper earthquakes, occurring at greater 
            depths, may dissipate their energy before reaching the surface, leading to less noticeable effects. 
            Therefore, a magnitude 6.0 earthquake that strikes at a depth of 10 kilometers can cause far more 
            damage than a magnitude 6.5 earthquake occurring at a depth of 100 kilometers.

          <p class = "body-text" style = "margin-bottom: 0px;">Each state in Australia faces unique risks associated with earthquakes, but the level of susceptibility 
            varies considerably. Historically, data reveals that <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #804413;">Western Australia</span> has experienced the highest number 
            of seismic events, followed by South Australia and New South Wales. However, it's essential to consider 
            the geographical context - <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #804413;">Western Australia</span>  spans an area 11 times larger than <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #0072B2;">Victoria</span>, which skews the 
            perception of its earthquake activity <a href="https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/national-location-information/dimensions/area-of-australia-states-and-territories" target="_blank">[4]</a>. Surprisingly, despite being the second-largest state, Queensland 
            ranks among the lowest for seismic occurrences. This discrepancy can largely be attributed to the complex 
            nature of tectonic activity and fault lines.

          <p class = "body-text" style = "margin-bottom: 40px; margin-top: 30px;">Earthquakes result from sudden movements along faults-fractures in the Earth's crust where tectonic plates 
            interact. These movements are driven by the immense pressure that builds up over time as plates shift. Tectonic plates are massive sections of the Earth's crust that float on 
            the semi-fluid mantle beneath them. These plates constantly move, albeit very slowly, due to convection currents in the mantle. The worst recorded earthquake occurred in 1960 
            near Valdivia, Chile, measuring a staggering 9.5 on the moment magnitude scale. Earthquakes are common in Chile due to it being placed near the South American Tectonic Plate boarders. </p>

            like <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #0072B2;">Victoria</span>, and New South Wales, located near more active tectonic boundaries, are at greater risk due to 
            the presence of several significant fault lines, such as the Napier and Tarrabool faults. Conversely, while 
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #804413;">Western Australia</span> has experienced many earthquakes, much of its seismic activity occurs in sparsely populated 
            areas, resulting in less damage and fewer reported impacts. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for assessing 
            earthquake risks and implementing effective preparedness strategies tailored to each state's unique geological 
            landscape. When considering the area of the two different states, it becomes more apparent that <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #0072B2;">Victoria</span> on average
          does experience more earthquakes per area than <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #804413;">Western Australia</span> as can be seen in the population pyramid to the right. Additionally, 
          the southern states typically experience more number of earthquakes, as can be seen in the bubble plot below with a lot of the nothern states data lying near the x-axis. </p>
