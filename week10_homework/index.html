          <p class = "body-text">Australia is not typically known for its seismic activity, but it has in the past
            experienced significant earthquakes that have shaped its landscape and communities. Experts are 
            concerned that due to long periods without excessive earthquake acitivity is causing us to be 
            complacent [1]. In September 2024, a new term was dubbed by seisomologists, 'earthquake swarms',
            after more than 30 seismic events recorded hit the Hunter region of New South Wales. While swarms 
            occurred naturally and are not uncommon, some human activities could induce them - such as mining.
            As such, experts are concerned about how buildings are being designed, and the location of very critical
            building proposals, such as where nuclear power plants could be built.

            NSW in 1989. The earthquake that hit Newcastle had a magnitude of 5.6 on the Richter scale [2]. It resulted in:
            <li> 13 lives: 9 people died at the Newcastle Workers Club, 3 people were killed in Beaumont Street Hamilton, and one person died of shock </li>
            <li> 160 people hospitalised</li>
            <li> 50,000 buildings were damaged (approximately 40,000 of these were homes)</li>
            <li> 300 buildings were demolished</li>
            <li> 300,000 people were affected and 1,000 were made homeless</li>

        <h2 style = "font-family: 'Righteous';">Earthquake Effects by Magnitude and Depth</h2>
        <div class="description description-left">
          <p class = "body-text" style = "margin-bottom: 0px;">Earthquake magnitude and depth are crucial factors 
            that significantly influence the level of damage caused by a seismic event. The magnitude of an 
            earthquake, measured on the Richter scale or the moment magnitude scale, quantifies the energy 
            released at the earthquake's source. Generally, higher magnitude earthquakes release more energy, 
            resulting in greater potential for destruction. Fortunately, Australia has never experienced an 
            earthquake of Magntiude higher than 6.4. However, the depth at which an earthquake occurs 
            also plays a vital role in determining its impact. Shallow earthquakes, typically occurring at 
            depths less than 70 kilometers, tend to cause more intense shaking and damage at the surface because 
            the seismic waves have less distance to travel. In contrast, deeper earthquakes, occurring at greater 
            depths, may dissipate their energy before reaching the surface, leading to less noticeable effects. 
            Therefore, a magnitude 6.0 earthquake that strikes at a depth of 10 kilometers can cause far more 
            damage than a magnitude 6.5 earthquake occurring at a depth of 100 kilometers.

          <h2 style = "font-family: 'Righteous';">Dangers of Earthquakes Per State</h2>
          <p class = "body-text" style = "margin-bottom: 0px;">Each state in Australia faces unique risks associated with earthquakes, but the level of susceptibility 
            varies considerably. Historically, data reveals that Western Australia has experienced the highest number 
            of seismic events, followed by South Australia and New South Wales. However, it's essential to consider 
            the geographical context—Western Australia spans an area 11 times larger than Victoria, which skews the 
            perception of its earthquake activity. Surprisingly, despite being the second-largest state, Queensland 
            ranks among the lowest for seismic occurrences. This discrepancy can largely be attributed to the complex 
            nature of tectonic activity and fault lines.

        <div class="description description-left">
          <p class = "body-text" style = "margin-bottom: 0px;">Earthquakes result from sudden movements along faults—fractures in the Earth's crust where tectonic plates 
            interact. These movements are driven by the immense pressure that builds up over time as plates shift. States 
            like Victoria and New South Wales, located near more active tectonic boundaries, are at greater risk due to 
            the presence of several significant fault lines, such as the Napier and Tarrabool faults. Conversely, while 
            Western Australia has experienced many earthquakes, much of its seismic activity occurs in sparsely populated 
            areas, resulting in less damage and fewer reported impacts. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for assessing 
            earthquake risks and implementing effective preparedness strategies tailored to each state's unique geological 
            landscape.</p>
